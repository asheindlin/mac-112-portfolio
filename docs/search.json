A computer is your audience. Thus be as precise as possible, but trust that the computer can find the exact numbers if you tell it where.\n\n\n\n\n\nCOMPONENTS OF GRAPHICS\nIn data viz, we essentially start with a blank canvas and then map data onto it. There are multiple possible mapping components. Some basics from Wickham (which goes into more depth):\n\na frame, or coordinate system\nThe variables or features that define the axes and gridlines of the canvas.\na layer\nThe geometric elements (e.g. lines, points) we add to the canvas to represent either the data points themselves or patterns among the data points. Each type of geometric element is a separate layer. These geometric elements are sometimes called “geoms” or “glyphs” (like heiroglyph!)\nscales\nThe aesthetics we might add to geometric elements (e.g. color, size, shape) to incorporate additional information about data scales or groups.\nfaceting\nThe splitting up of the data into multiple subplots, or facets, to examine different groups within the data.\na theme\nAdditional controls on the “finer points” of the plot aesthetics, (e.g. font type, background, color scheme).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEXAMPLE\nIn the NYT graphic, the data was mapped to the plot as follows:\n\nframe: x-axis = date, y-axis = temp\nlayers: add one line per year, add dots for each month in 2023\nscales: color each line by decade\nfaceting: none\na theme: NYT style",

It gives us a sense of ranges and typical outcomes, but not a good sense of how the observations are distributed across this range. We’ll explore two methods for graphing quantitative variables: histograms and density plots.\nHistograms are constructed by (1) dividing up the observed range of the variable into ‘bins’ of equal width; and (2) counting up the number of cases that fall into each bin.

    "text": "5.2 New stuff\nThus far, we’ve been studying one variable at a time, using univariate plots. But once we get a sense of how individual variables behave on their own, our questions often turn to relationships among variables. For example, in our hikes data:\n\nHow much time does it take to complete a hike? ——&gt; How is time related to a hike’s elevation? What about its length?\nHow does difficult rating vary from hike to hike? ——-&gt; How is difficulty rating related to a hike’s ascent?\n\n\n5.2.1 Exploring relationships\nExploring univariate patterns often sparks follow-up questions about relationships between 2+ variables. Often, but not always, variables take on specific roles:\n\nresponse variable: the variable whose variability we would like to explain (time to complete a hike)\npredictors: variables that might explain some of the variability in the response (a hike’s elevation or length)\n\nVisualizations can help explore:\n\nrelationship trends (direction and form)\nrelationship strength (degree of variability from the trend)\noutliers in the relationship\n\n\nEXAMPLE 3\nFor each pair of variables below, sketch on paper a visualization of their relationship.

In general:\n\nEach quantitative variable requires a new axis (or a quantitative scale if we run out of axes).\nEach categorical variable requires a new way to “group” the graphic (eg: using colors, shapes, separate facets, etc)\nFor visualizations in which overlap in glyphs or plots obscures the patterns, try faceting or transparency.",

Construct a plot of repub_pct_20.\nNotice that the distribution of Republican support from county to county is slightly left skewed or negatively skewed.\nWhat follow-up questions do you have?\n\n\n\nExercise 1: Quantitative vs Quantitative Intuition Check\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBe Quick\n\n\n\nDon’t spend more than 3 minutes on this!\n\n\nBelow is a scatterplot of the Republican support in 2020 vs 2016. Notice that:\n\nboth variables are quantitative, and get their own axes\nthe response variable is on the y-axis, demonstrating how repub_pct_20 might be predicted by repub_pct_16, not vice versa\n\nTry to replicate this using ggplot(). THINK:\n\nWhat info do you need to set up the canvas?\nWhat geometric layer (geom_???) might add these dots / points for each county? We haven’t learned this yet, just take some guesses.\n\n\n\n\nExercise 2: 2 Quantitiative Variables\nRun each chunk below to build up a a scatterplot of repub_pct_20 vs repub_pct_16 with different glyphs representing each county. Address or think about any prompts in the comments (#).\n\n# Set up the plotting frame\n# How does this differ than the frame for our histogram of repub_pct_20 alone?\nggplot(elections, aes(y = repub_pct_20, x = repub_pct_16))\n\n\n# Add a layer of points for each county\n# Take note of the geom!\nggplot(elections, aes(y = repub_pct_20, x = repub_pct_16)) +\n  geom_point()\n\n\n# Change the shape of the points\n# What happens if you change the shape to another number?\nggplot(elections, aes(y = repub_pct_20, x = repub_pct_16)) +\n  geom_point(shape = 3)\n\n\n# YOU TRY: Modify the code to make the points \"orange\"\n# NOTE: Try to anticipate if \"color\" or \"fill\" will be useful here.

Be sure to comment on:\n\nthe strength of the relationship (weak/moderate/strong)\n\nthe direction of the relationship (positive/negative)\n\noutliers (in what state do counties deviate from the national trend? Any ideas why this might be the case?)\n\n\n\nExercise 4: Visualizing trend\nThe trend of the relationship between repub_pct_20 and repub_pct_16 is clearly positive and (mostly) linear. We can highlight this trend by adding a model “smooth” to the plot:\n\nggplot(elections, aes(y = repub_pct_20, x = repub_pct_16)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth()\n\n\nPart a\nConstruct a new plot that contains the model smooth but does not include the individual point glyphs.\n\n\nPart b\nBy default, geom_smooth() adds a smooth, localized model line. To examine the “best” linear model, we can specify method = \"lm\". It’s pretty similar in this example!\n\nggplot(elections, aes(y = repub_pct_20, x = repub_pct_16)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\")\n\n\n\n\nExercise 5: Your Turn\nTo examine how the 2020 results are related to some county demographics, construct scatterplots of repub_pct_20 vs median_rent, and repub_pct_20 vs median_age. Summarize the relationship between these two variables and comment on which is the better predictor of repub_pct_20, median_rent or median_age.\n\n# Scatterplot of repub_pct_20 vs median_rent\n\n\n\n# Scatterplot of repub_pct_20 vs median_age\n\n\n\nExercise 6: A Sad Scatterplot\nNext, let’s explore the relationship between a county’s 2020 Republican support repub_pct_20 and the historical political trends in its state. In this case repub_pct_20 is quantitative, but historical is categorical. Explain why a scatterplot might not be an effective visualization for exploring this relationship. (What questions does / doesn’t it help answer?)\n\nggplot(elections, aes(y = repub_pct_20, x = historical)) +\n  geom_point()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise 7: Quantitative vs Categorical – Violins & Boxes\nThough the above scatterplot did group the counties by historical category, it’s nearly impossible to pick out meaningful patterns in 2020 Republican support in each category. Let’s try adding 2 different geom layers to the frame:\n\n# Side-by-side violin plots\nggplot(elections, aes(y = repub_pct_20, x = historical)) +\n  geom_violin()\n\n\n# Side-by-side boxplots (defined below)\nggplot(elections, aes(y = repub_pct_20, x = historical)) +\n  geom_boxplot()\n\nBox plots are constructed from five numbers - the minimum, 25th percentile, median, 75th percentile, and maximum value of a quantitative variable:\n\nREFLECT:\nSummarize what you’ve learned about the 2020 Republican county-level support within and between red/purple/blue states.\n\n\nExercise 8: Quantitative vs Categorical – Intuition Check\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBe Quick\n\n\n\nDon’t spend more than 3 minutes on this!\n\n\nWe can also visualize the relationship between repub_pct_20 and historical using our familiar density plots. In the plot below, notice that we simply created a separate density plot for each historical category. (The plot itself is “bad” but we’ll fix it below.)

That is, let’s explore the relationship between 2 categorical variables! Following the same themes as above, we can utilize grouping features such as fill/color or facets to distinguish between different categories of winner_20 and historical.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBe Quick\n\n\n\nSpend at most 5 minutes on the following intuition check.

But they’re not the only way to visualize the variables in our dataset.\n\nOptional Exercise 1: Many Categories\nSuppose we wanted to better understand how the 2020 Republican support varied from county to county within each state. Since repub_pct_20 is quantitative and state_abbr is categorical, we could make a density plot of repub_pct_20 for each state. Reflect on why this is bad.\n\nggplot(elections, aes(x = repub_pct_20, fill = state_abbr)) + \n  geom_density(alpha = 0.5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA facet wrap would also be bad!\n\nggplot(elections, aes(x = repub_pct_20)) + \n  geom_density(alpha = 0.5) + \n  facet_wrap(~ state_abbr)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen we want to compare the distribution of some quantitative outcome among many groups / categories, a ridgeline plot can be a good option. These are also called joy plots, named after the album cover for “Unknown Pleasures” by Joy Division. (Look it up!) To make a ridgeline plot, we can use the geom_density_ridges() function from the ggridges package.\n\n# Install ggridges package\nlibrary(ggridges)\n\n# Make our first joy plot\n# THINK: What DON'T you like about this?\nggplot(elections, aes(x = repub_pct_20, y = state_abbr)) + \n  geom_density_ridges()\n\n\n# Let's put the states in order by Republican support, not alphabet\n# How do you think fct_reorder works?

The least?\nWhat other interesting patterns do you notice?\nDoes this plot prompt any other questions?\n\n\n\nOptional Exercise 2: Total Outcomes by State\nLet’s import some new data and counts up the total votes (Republican and Democratic) by state, not county. This was wrangled from the elections data!\n\nelections_by_state &lt;- read.csv(\"https://mac-stat.github.io/data/election_2020_by_state.csv\")\n\nFor example, we might make a scatterplot of the 2020 vs 2016 outcomes:\n\nggplot(elections_by_state, aes(y = repub_pct_20, x = repub_pct_16)) + \n  geom_point()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBUT this isn’t the easiest way to communicate or identify the changes from 1 year to the next.\n\n# YOU TRY\n# Start by creating a \"scatterplot\" of state_abbr (y-axis) by 2020 Republican support on the x-axis\n# Color the points red\n# Scroll to solutions below when you're ready\n\n\n# Check it out\nggplot(elections_by_state, aes(x = repub_pct_20, y = state_abbr)) + \n  geom_point(color = \"red\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# YOU TRY\n# Reorder the states in terms of their 2020 Republican support (not alphabet)\n# Scroll to solutions below when you're ready\n\n\n# Check it out\nggplot(elections_by_state, aes(x = repub_pct_20, y = fct_reorder(state_abbr, repub_pct_20))) + \n  geom_point(color = \"red\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Finally, add ANOTHER layer of points for the 2016 outcomes\n# What info does this new geom_point() layer need to run?\nggplot(elections_by_state, aes(x = repub_pct_20, y = fct_reorder(state_abbr, repub_pct_20))) + \n  geom_point(color = \"red\") + \n  geom_point(aes(x = repub_pct_16, y = state_abbr))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReflect on the following\n\nWhat do you think this plot needs? Try it! You might need to do some digging online.\nSummarize the main takeaways from the plots. Which states changed the most from 2016 to 2020? The least? Where did the Republican support increase? Where did it decrease?\nWhat other questions are you left with?",
